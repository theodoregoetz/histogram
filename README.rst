histogram
=========

A histogram object written in Python for scientific data-reduction and
statistical analysis

The primary object of this module is a continuous-domain `histogram
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram>`__. Any number of dimensions is
supported though only the lower dimensions can be visualized. For more
information, see the following documentation:

-  `wiki pages <https://github.com/theodoregoetz/histogram/wiki>`__
-  `API Reference <http://theodoregoetz.github.io/histogram>`__

This package is dependent on `NumPy and SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`__,
provides methods for producing and showing graphics through `Matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.org>`__ and can be serialized via python's pickling, NumPy's
binary format or `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org>`__.

For collecting statistics on discrete keys or catagories you may want to look
into the `collections.Counter
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter>`__
class.

Quick Start
-----------

In this module, the histogram is elevated to its own object, effectively
merging the array and associated edges returned by the
``numpy.histogramdd()`` method. Creating, filling and displaying a
histogram should be as simple as this example:

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot
    from histogram import Histogram, plothist

    np.random.seed(1)

    h = Histogram(100,[0,10])
    h.fill(np.random.normal(5,1,10000))
    plothist(h)

    pyplot.show()

Similar Packages and Software
-----------------------------

While there is no lack of other histogramming libraries out there, most have a
narrow focus or seem to be quickly put together, lacking documentation, or are
part of a much larger analysis framework. The goal of this project is to be a
solution for all python developers who want just a bit more functionality than
that provided by NumPy's ``histogramdd()`` method.

This project took many cues from the following python packages, trying to merge
the features of each one into a single object:

-  `histogram <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/histogram>`__
-  `pyhistogram <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyhistogram>`__
-  `histogramy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/histogramy>`__
-  `pypeaks <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypeaks>`__
-  `SimpleHist <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimpleHist>`__
-  `hist <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hist>`__
-  `hierogram <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hierogram>`__
-  `histo <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/histo>`__
-  `python-metrics <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-metrics>`__
-  `statscounter <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/statscounter>`__
-  `multihist <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/multihist>`__
-  `vaex <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vaex>`__
-  `datagram <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/datagram>`__
-  `hdrhistogram <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hdrhistogram>`__
-  `dashi <http://www.ifh.de/~middell/dashi/index.html>`__
-  `physt <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/physt>`__
-  `matplotlib-hep <https://github.com/ibab/matplotlib-hep>`__

Furthermore, the author was greatly influenced by the histogram classes found
in `CERN's ROOT data analysis framework <https://root.cern.ch>`__.
